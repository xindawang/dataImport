DESCRIPTION/PURPOSE
To identify adjustable cost with an adjustable cost code, a percentage rate and/ or the value
of the cost, an adjustable cost description, the sequence of the calculation and the
applicable currency.
CODE(S)

REMARK(S)
To enable an eventual automatic system validation of invoicing messages the calculation rules need
to be commonly agreed within a project. The usage of the ACQ within ACA allows for flexible
calculation of adjustable costs and, at the same time, communicates the applied calculation rules to
the recipient. The usage of the ACQ must be agreed within a project/contract.

REMARK(S)
For certain major Projects and with agreement between Industry and the Customer, an
AGERD Documentation System may be used to identify each maintenance function for
which Ground Equipment is required.
Where an AGERD System is in use, it will be applied only to items having an ITEM TYPE
code of AG.
It should be noted that an AGERD identifies a maintenance function but it does not always
uniquely identify a Support Equipment item. Item identification is achieved by the item

REMARK(S)
The use of the Material Item Category Code (MICC) and the Chapterization is to be agreed
between Customer and Contractor at the start of the project.
The MICC is described in S1000D, Chap. 4.3.3.
The "Chapterization" allocated to Support Equipment, Tools and Test Equipment in S1000D
consists of special alpha characters and is not used in the construction of the 
figureItemIdentifier. The rules for the compilation of Support Equipment, Tools and Test
Equipment are given in Chapter 1-0.
When an item appears in the IP presentation (and IPC) for the Product, the whole of this
data element is to be provided. When the Material Item Category Code is not used and /or a
shortened version of Subject is agreed, positions not used are to be left blank. When an
item is contained in the separate IP presentation of equipments then only the last seven
positions are applicable and the first nine are to be left blank.
The data entered in the first four positions of the figureItemIdentifier is to be taken from the
Standard Numbering System for the Product chapterization defined by S1000D.
The data entered in the succeeding positions will be allocated by the Contractor in such a
way to give clarity of presentation, considering the complexity and data presentation
requirements of each Sub-Chapter or Sub-Sub-Chapter or Unit.
The following rules for Figure and Item Number allocation will apply:
EXAMPLE(S)
(a) Figure Number allocation
In the Product IP presentation, numerical Figure Numbers are to be allocated
sequentially commencing with 01. The allocated range of Figure Numbers will be
within the same Chapter, Sub-Chapter, Sub-Sub-Chapter and Unit and, when a
change to these first nine characters of the CSN is encountered, a new figure range
starting with 01 is to be started.
In the separate IP presentation of equipment, only one figure range will be created.
This will allow for 99 numerical figures to be allocated. If the breakdown of an
equipment requires more than 99 figures to adequately present the data, the first
character of the Figure Number is to be allocated as an alpha. The range, in these
circumstances, will commence A1 to A9 then B1 to B9 and so on until Z9. This will
allow for 234 different figures to be allocated.
Within a single IP presentation the two methods of figure allocation must not be
mixed. When an IP presentation requires more than 99 figures then the first figure
must be identified as A1. It is not permissible to commence with 01 and later to
progress to the alphanumeric figure range.
On the initial presentation of data, the Figure Number Variant is to be left blank. The
Figure Number Variants are to be reserved for inserting new Figures which may
have been omitted from, or, through some subsequent action, need to be added to
the data which has already been presented.
When changes occur subsequent to the initial presentation of data they will normally
be incorporated into the existing figures. However, if the change is as a result of a
modification to the figure's top item and the post modification breakdown of the item
is incompatible with the pre-modification breakdown, it may be necessary to create a
new figure to maintain a comprehensive presentation of the pre and post
modification data. In these circumstances, the new figure will be allocated the next
consecutive Figure Number Variant to the existing figure being modified. If the
existing figure has no Figure Number Variant, the new figure will be allocated Variant
'A'.
(i) A new figure needs to be created as a post modification state of figure 21.

After

After

24M  24M  (Pre Modification figure)

25 
When a new I figure is to be inserted, the Figure Number Variant should be allocated
so as to divide the remaining available alpha range to permit the greatest flexibility
for future creation of new figures.
(iii) A new figure needs to be inserted between figures 26 and 27

(b) Item Number Allocation
The top item of a figure, representing the illustrated item, is to be allocated Item
Number 000 and from there on, the numbers are allocated consecutively (starting with
001) in an uninterrupted numerical sequence throughout the figure. This uninterrupted
sequence, which will exist when the data is compiled, could subsequently become
interrupted when changes are introduced or customized extractions are made.
The Item Number Variants are to be reserved for inserting new items which may have
been omitted from, or, through some subsequent action, need to be added to the data
which has already been presented.
If, subsequent to the initial presentation of data, an item is introduced which
completely replaces, or is a different configuration standard of, an existing item, this
new item will be presented with the same Item Number (see paragraph on Variants/
Different Configuration Standards later).
When an additional new item is to be inserted, the Item Number Variant should be
allocated so as to divide the remaining available Alpha range to permit the greatest
flexibility for future insertions at this location. As a general rule this would result in the
insertion splitting the Alpha range equally, however, where functional relationships
ensure that no additional inserts would arise between the two items, the next
consecutive Alpha may be allocated.
(i) A new item has to be added between items 20 and 21.

item 20 in a way which would not permit an additional insert between them.

Whenever an item appears more than once at the same indentureLevel (IND) in an
illustrated assembly or sub-assembly, it should be given just one Item Number and be
listed just once, with its quantityInNextHigherAssembly (QNA) reflecting the multiple
occurrence. If an item appears in different sub-assemblies, it must not be allocated the
same Item Number.
Certain items are to be listed at the same Item Number with different
figureItemSequenceNumber (ISN), to indicate their applicability to a particular location
in a figure and their relationship to the illustrated item. The different types of items
which should be listed at the same Item Number are as follows:
(1) Variants/Different Configuration Standards
When a Change is introduced by a modification, the pre and post modified items are
to be listed at the same Item Number.
When different item variants or different item configuration standards are included in
the same IP presentation to utilize a common breakdown, the relationship of the
breakdown items with their respective equipment or assembly should be identified by
the USABLE ON CODE EQUIPMENT (UCE) or USABLE ON CODE ASSEMBLY
(UCA).
(2) Interchangeability
When two or more items are interchangeable they should be listed at the same Item
Number and each should carry its relevant interchangeability (PIY and SIY).
(3) Select on Fit or  Test items
When the range of Select-on-Test or Select-on-Fit items is presented at the location
at which the item is used, and not held in a separate General Tolerance Figure, the
whole of this range is to be listed with the same Item Number. Each item in the range
will also carry the appropriate figureItemSelectCondition (SMF).
(4) Mirrored Items
When two like items have a mirrored application in a Left Hand/Right Hand,
Upper/Lower or Fore/Aft relationship and have a like or similar engineering
breakdown, that breakdown may be shown as a single Figure. In these
circumstances the relationship of the breakdown items to their respective mirrored
item must be through the USABLE ON CODE ASSEMBLY (UCA).
(5) Special Repair Parts
When a special repair part is a one-for-one replacement with another item they
should be listed together, at the same Item Number. The repair part will be identified
as ‘(Repair Part)’ in the figureItemDescription and the item it replaces will have
an SMF of ‘P’.
(6) Special Spares Condition n
When a Special Spares item carries a different partIdentifier (PID) to the production
build item it should be listed together with the production build item at the same Item
Number. The Special Spares condition item will be the recommended spare whilst
the production build item will be listed as a non-recommended item.
(7)  Different QNA and/or different versions
When two or more items need to be listed due to different QNA and/or different
versions then the breakdown of the item will be repeated in line with the next higher
Assembly.

Position six to nine  Project serial number allocated by the responsible Contractor.
The Provisioning Project Numbers for Part-Oriented messages are to be allocated
differently than those for any other Initial Provisioning List presentation. In particular it has to
be avoided that the same Provisioning Project Number is used for both a Part-Oriented
message and a CSN-Oriented message.
REMARK(S)
The IP presentation for a Product will be broken down into several IP packages each
allocated its own IPP.
The separate IP presentations for equipment will each receive one IPP and will usually
cover all variants of the equipment in a single IP presentation.
An IPP, once assigned, will not be changed, even if at some later stage the responsibility for
an IPP is moved from one Company to another.
The allocation of IPPs and the division of the IP presentation for the Product will be jointly
agreed between the Contractor and Customer. This agreement may also include the
allocation of significant serial numbers (an Format) to relate IP projects to weapon systems
or to group projects into specific categories. The IPP is to be unique within an MFC of the
responsible Contractor; see Data Element Sheet for partIdentifier (PID).

Ch.1 (provisioning)
DESCRIPTION/PURPOSE
The figureItemSequenceNumber (ISN), together with the figureItemIdentifier (CSN) provides
the key for each record in the Initial Provisioning (IP) presentation of data. It is also the key to
the sequence within the Item Number in which records will be presented in the Illustrated
Parts Catalogue.
CODE(S)
Position one & two Enter the numeric sequence number starting 00.
Position three  Enter variant number starting A through to Z then 0 through to
9 (except alpha I and O).
REMARK(S)
Enter 00A where only one item is listed at a particular Item Number.
Enter 00A for the first item, of several, listed at the same Item Number.
In determining the identity of an Item Number, the Item Number Variant must also be
considered. For Example 20, 20J and 20R are all different Item Numbers. The allocation of
figureItemSequenceNumbers beyond the first item is dependent upon the type of items listed
at the Item Number and must be carried out under the following rules:
(1) VARIANTS
Variants are different versions of a Product or Equipment which because of their high degree
of commonality of breakdown may, for the purpose of efficiency, be presented together in a
single Initial Provisioning List/Illustrated Parts Catalogue. Variants of equipment will normally
be included in the same Product at different locations or in the same location on different
Product Variants and will each have its configuration standard independently maintained. A
configuration change introduced to equipment or equipment variant at the same location is not
considered to be introducing a new variant. Such a change is considered as a 'different
configuration standard', for which the ISN allocation is described in paragraph (2).
Variants are liable to modification changes which will result in the need to add additional line
entries between pre allocated ISNs. For this reason the ISN allocation against Variants is
designed to leave a large range of available ISNs between the variants. This allocation is to
apply both to the range of variants when presented in the initial IP and also to any subsequent
addition of a variant, which is a new item (not simply a differently configured standard of an
existing variant).
The ISN is to be allocated with the numerical sequence number increasing in steps of five.
For example:
Item Number  ISN
Variant A  0  00A
Variant B  0  05A
Variant C  0  10A
(2) DIFFERENT CONFIGURATION  STANDARDS
Configuration standard changes should not normally be subject to subsequent interposing
action, however, it is possible for the classification of a modification to demand that the mod is
presented ahead of its natural configuration progression and in these circumstances (and
possibly others) this interposing action will be necessary. The gap to be left in the allocation of
the ISNs therefore need only be sufficient to provide a safety margin in case the need to
interpose a record arises.
The ISN is to be allocated with the Variant number increasing in steps of five.
For example:
p p artIdentifier  Item Number  ISN
A  (pre mod 1)  6  00A
B  (post mod 1) (pre mod 2)  6  00F
C  (post mod 2)  6  00L
Subsequent ISN allocations, should further modification action take place, would be: 00R,
00W, 001, 006, 01A, 01F etc.
(3) INTERCHANGEABILITY
The presentation of two or more interchangeable items, at the same Configuration Standard
will not be subject to subsequent changes, which require interposing action. The reason for
this is because when a change is applied to interchangeable items, it must not break the link
between them instead the result should be a pre-change group of interchangeable items
followed by a post-change group. The allocation of ISNs for interchangeable items, which are
presented at the same Configuration Standard, can therefore be consecutive, because the
need will not arise to interpose an item between them.
For example:
partIdentifier
A
PIY/SIY
-4
Item
Number
21
ISN
00A
B  44  21  00B
C  4-  21  00C
The allocation of consecutive ISNs for interchangeable items only applies to those items
presented at the same Configuration Standard. When items which are presented at different
Configuration Standards also attract interchangeability codes, these items should be allocated
ISNs according to the rules of the previous paragraph (2)-Different Configuration Standards-
which states allocate the Variant number in steps of five.
(4) SELECT- - ON- - TEST (SOT). SELECT- - ON- - FI T (SOF)
As with Variants, these items are also subject to configuration changes, but they will not
attract the same intensity of modifications. The allocation of ISNs therefore is to be
consecutive through the numerical sequence number.
p p artIdentifier  S S MF  Item Number  ISN
X  T  13  00A
Y  T  13  01A
Z  T  13  02A
(5) MIRRORED ITEMS
As with Variants, the presentation of Mirrored Items utilises the USABLE ON CODE
EQUIPMENT or USABLE ON CODE ASSEMBLY and a combined breakdown to avoid
duplication and inefficient data presentation.
Also, the Mirrored Items may attract the same intensity of modifications that is associated with
Variants. For this reason the rules for allocating the ISN are the same as for Variants: allocate
with the numerical sequence number increasing in steps of five.
Item Number  ISN
Mirrored item (left hand)  0  00A
Mirrored item (right hand)  0  05A
(6) SPECIAL REPAIR PARTS, SPECIAL SPARES CONDITION ITEM
Special Repair Parts, Special Spares Condition Items and their associated Production Build
items will also attract configuration changes, but as a general rule, these changes should not
require interposing action between the Production Build item and its Special Repair Parts or
Special Spares Condition counterpart. This is because there will usually be a need to maintain
the link between the Production Build item and its Special Repair Parts or Special Spares
Condition counterpart and the application of a modification will result in a pre-modification
linked pair and a post-modification linked pair. Nevertheless, the requirement for this linking
cannot be guaranteed and therefore the ISN allocation needs to allow gaps between the
items. The same rules as those given for SOT and SOF items are to be used: allocate
consecutive numerical sequence numbers.
EXAMPLE  Item Number  ISN
‘Production’ item  22  00A
Repair Part  22  01A
‘Production’ item  53  00A
Special Spares Condition  53  01A
(7) REWORKED ITEM
If an item can be reworked through the in-service application of a Modification Kit and the
resulting reworked item attracts a different partIdentifier from the production line post
modification standard, it should be listed and identified with an SMFI CODE of R. This
reworked item should be given the same Item Number as the ‘pre-modification’ item and the
partIdentifier of the ‘pre-modification’ item should be provided in the SMFR. If a production
line post-modification standard of the item is also presented, then the sequence in which
these three items should appear is, pre-modification, reworked, post-modification, and all
three items should have the same Item Number. As with ‘Different Configuration Standards’,
the ISN is to be allocated with the ISN variant number increasing in steps of five.
EXAMPLE  Item Number  ISN  p p artIdentifier  SMF  MFM PIY/SIY
23  00A  A (pre mod 1) 
23  00F  A1 (post mod 1)  R  A  1 2
23  00L  B (post mod 1) R  A  2 -
Subsequent ISN allocations, should further modifications take place, would be: 00R, 00W,
001, 006, 01A, 01F etc.

DESCRIPTION/PURPOSE
The precedingFigureItemSequenceNumberInterchangeability (PIY) together with the
succeedingFigureItemSequenceNumberInterchangeability (SIY) indicate the
interchangeability of two or more items at the same location either for the same configuration
or, when a partIdentifier change is involved, across two different Configuration Standards.
CODE(S)
BLANK =  This indicates that the interchangeability condition cannot be positively identified
or represented. Items presented at the same location with interchangeability
‘blank’ may, or may not, be interchangeable. The use of interchangeability
‘blank’ will only have application for items presented at different Configuration
Standards.
EXAMPLE
partIdentifier Preceding
(PIY)
Succeeding
(S IY)
A  (Pre Mod 1) 
B  (Post Mod 1) 
Indicates that no positive interchangeability condition exists between parts A
and B.

Both of the items must carry code ‘0’. The use of code ‘0’ will only have
application for items presented at different Configuration Standards.

= Indicates full interchangeability with the following applications:
Interchangeability codes ‘1’ and ‘2’ must always be used one with the other, and
may be used for two items presented at the same Configuration Standard, or for
two items at different Configuration Standards.
For two interchangeable items at the same Configuration Standard, code ‘1’
identifies the item whose source of supply is running out and code ‘2’ identifies
the preferred, replacement, item.
When the two interchangeable items are at different Configuration Standards the
code ‘1’ item will be the pre-modified item and the code ‘2’ the post-modified item.
For technical or supply reasons code ‘1’ items may no longer be procured, but
existing stocks will need to be used up.
This may be achieved by controlling the issue of the code ‘2’ item until the code
‘1’ item stock is exhausted. This, however, might result in the replacement of a
code ‘2’ item (which was installed during series production) with a code ‘1’ (being
used until stocks are exhausted) which could in some instances constitute a
demodification action.
EXAMPLE (same Configuration Standard)
PartIdentifier Preceding
(PIY)
Succeeding
(SIY)
A  -  1
B  2  -
Items A and B are fully interchangeable but B is preferred and A is running out of
supply.
EXAMPLE (different Configuration Standard)
PartIdentifier Preceding
(PIY)
Succeeding
(SIY)
A  (Pre Mod 1)  -  1
B  (Post Mod 1)  2  -
Items A and B are at different Configuration Standards and are fully
interchangeable.
3 =  Indicates an item that has a one way interchangeability with another
(interchangeability code ‘5’) item.
The use of interchangeability code ‘3’ must always be accompanied with an
interchangeable ‘5’ item and will only be applied to items presented at different
Configuration Standards.
The code ‘3’ is applied to the pre-modified item and code ‘5’ is applied to the post-
modified item.
A code ‘3’ item may only be used as a replacement where a code ‘3’ item is
installed, but a code ‘5’ item may be used to replace either a code ‘3’ or a code
‘5’.
EXAMPLE
PartIdentifier Preceding
(PIY)
Succeeding
(SIY)
A  (Pre Mod 1)  -  3
B  (Post Mod 1)  5  -
One way interchangeability shows B may replace A, but A cannot replace B
(which must be replaced by B).
EXAMPLE
PartIdentifier  Preceding
(PIY)
Succeeding
(SIY)
A  (Pre Mod 1)  -  3
B  (Post Mod 1) (Pre Mod 2)  5  3
C  (Post Mod 2)  5  -
The one way interchangeability links show that part A can be replaced by A, B, or
C that part B can be replaced by B or C and that C can only be replaced by C.
EXAMPLE
PartIdentifier Preceding
(PIY)
Succeeding
(SIY)
A  (Pre Mod 1)  -  4
B  (Pre Mod 1)  4  3
C  (Post Mod 1)  5  -
Mod 1 which has introduced C has brought a one-way interchangeability between
the pre-mod PartIdentifiers A and B and the post mod item C. As
interchangeability ‘4’ applies between A and B then parts A and B can be
replaced by A, B or C. Part C must be replaced by part C.
4 =  Indicates an item which is fully interchangeable with, but not identical to, other
interchangeable ‘4’ items. It is to be used only when the items are presented at
the same Configuration Standard. When items are presented at different
Configuration Standards then codes 1-2 or 3-5 must be applied.
EXAMPLE
PartIdentifier Preceding
(PIY)
Succeeding
(SIY)
A  -  4
B  4  -
A and B are fully interchangeable.
EXAMPLE
PartIdentifier Preceding
(PIY)
Succeeding
(SIY)
A  (Pre Mod 1)  -  4
B  (Pre Mod 1)  4  3
C  (Post Mod 1)  5  4
D  (Post Mod 1)  4  -
This indicates parts A and B are fully interchangeable and that C and D are fully
interchangeable, and that the mod has introduced a one way interchangeability
between the pre and post mod items.
5 =  Indicates an item which has a one way interchangeability with another (code ‘3’)
item. The use of interchangeable code ‘5’ must always be accompanied with an
interchangeable code ‘3’ item and will only be applied to items presented at
different Configuration Standards.
See code ‘3’ for details of application.
6 =  Indicates an item which has a qualified interchangeability with another
interchangeable ‘6’ item. The conditions under which this qualified
interchangeability is operative should be provided in the figureItemDescription.
7 =  Indicates an obsolete item where the Customer has confirmed that there is no
requirement for a replacement, irrespective of whether there are other ICY 2, 4 or
9 items available.
The ICY-code 7 will be inserted at all locations in the IP Data where the obsolete
item occurs.
8 =  Not used.
9 =  Indicates an item which is fully interchangeable with, and identical to, other
interchangeable ‘9’ items. It is to be used when a secondary PartIdentifier is
shown, for example, a Vendor allocated identity to a proprietary item which can
otherwise be supplied direct by the proprietary firm. In such cases the proprietary
item will be listed first followed by the Vendor’s partIdentifier (PID). A proprietary
item is one which is identified by a Primary Reference Number as defined in
ACodP 1.
Interchangeable ‘9’ related items would always qualify for the same NSN.
Interchangeability ‘9’ is to be used only when items are presented at the same
Configuration Standard.
- =  Used as a ‘filler’ to make clear the position of a single numerical code presented
in the interchangeability field.
REMARK(S)
APPLICATION
The PIY and SIY codes will only be applied when two or more interchangeable items are
presented at the same location.
The numeric PIY and SIY codes will only be used where interchangeability conditions have
been positively identified.
As the interchangeability of different Configuration Standards will be defined by the Change
Authority introducing the change, the level of breakdown to which the PIY and SIY codes can
be applied will be dependent upon that which is expressed by the Change Authority. It may,
therefore, not be possible to identify the interchangeability condition down to full breakdown
level in all cases.
When applied across different configuration standards, the interchangeability is to be read in
conjunction with the serialNumberLowerBound and the serialNumberUpperBound.
The precedingFigureItemSequenceNumberInterchangeability (PIY) must always be presented
with and read in conjuction with the succeedingFigureItemSequenceNumberInterchangeability
(SIY).
The precedingFigureItemSequenceNumberInterchangeability (PIY) code will be provided only
for items which have a figureItemReasonForSelection (RFS) other than 0.
The data field contains two characters; the first character is used to indicate the item’s
interchangeability with the preceding item and the second is used to indicate the item’s
interchangeability with the succeeding item listed.
partIdentifier  Preceding (PIY) Succeeding
(SIY)
A  -  9
B  9  -
This indicates an interchangeability 9-9 condition between partIdentifiers A and B.
This code structure allows the evolution of further interchangeability conditions to be
represented whilst still maintaining a historic record.
FURTHER EXAMPLE
partIdentifier  Preceding
(PIY)
Succeeding
(SIY)
A  (Pre Mod 1)  -  9
B  (Pre Mod 1)  9  1
A1  (Post Mod 1)  2  9
B1  (Post Mod 1)  9  -
This indicates two interchangeable 9 items being modified to produce two new
interchangeable 9 items. Because succeeding and preceding interchangeability codes are
held separately the whole interchangeability development can be represented.
The example effectively shows the following:
A  9 
interchangeable 1 
B  9 
interchangeable
A1  9 
interchangeable 2 
B1  9 
NB. As interchangeability 9-9 indicates full interchangeability, the interchangeability 1-2
condition can be read also to the Parts Numbers A and B1.

DESCRIPTION/PURPOSE
The partMaintenanceSolution is structured in the same manner as SMR, but it is parts
related and not location related. It describes the general statement about the maintenance
solution without any restriction of location.
This code is used to identify in a structured manner, the Maintenance and Overhaul
activities that may be performed on a part. It provides information on Source, and
instructions on Repair responsibilities, identifying methods of Repair (i.e. Procure, Replace,
and Manufacture) and instructions on disposal of unserviceable parts.
CODE(S)
The partMaintenanceSolution consists of five parts as follows:
-  First and Second character: partSourcingStrategy (PSS)
-  Third character: partChangeabilityStrategy (PCS)
-  Fourth character: partOverhaulabilityStrategy (POS)
-  Fifth character: partRecoverabilityStrategy (PRS)
-  Sixth character: partNationalSpecificClassification (PNC)
REMARK(S)
If an Item has different SMR-codes at multiple locations, then the PMS should be to the
lowest common factor. That means if the SMR-code differs per location then the PMS has to
state the maximum requirement.
EXAMPLE(S)

DESCRIPTION/PURPOSE
A combination of characters assigned to identify without ambiguity an item manufactured to
a certain design intent.
To ensure no ambiguity exists PART NUMBER must be assigned in conjunction with the
COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT ENTITY (MFC) to ensure exclusivity. This is because
more than one company can assign the same PART NUMBER, but for different items.
CODE(S)
- --
REMARK(S)
The PART NUMBER allocated by the design right owner (who may not necessarily be the
Manufacturer) must be given as the prime PART NUMBER unless the item is a national or
international standard part which has been authorized for use in that particular application
by the design authority of the equipment in which it is fitted.
For national and international standard parts, the PART NUMBER used in the standard is to
be used together with the COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT ENTITY of the national or
international Authority controlling the standard e.g. K7766 for British Standards Institution
(BSI), I9005 for European Standards (ASD) and 80205 for National American Standards
(NAS).
PART NUMBERS must always be definitive.
The Formatting of the PART NUMBER is to be in agreement with the NATO Manual on
Codification ACodP-1.
In NATO Codification procedures, a partNumber is known as a ‘Reference Number’.

DESCRIPTION/PURPOSE
Indicates the relationship of a Reference Number (partIdentifier) to the item of supply.
CODE(S)
See the following Table (Taken from the NATO Manual on Codification ACodP-1):
CODE  EXPLANATION 
1  Source Control Reference. The number assigned by a design activity to a
drawing that depicts existing commercial or vendor items which exclusively
provide performance, installation and interchangeable CHARACTERISTICS
required for one or more specific critical applications. Restrictions are
imposed by the design activity to ensure procurement of the only item(s)
known, as a result of test or evaluation, to qualify for the stated critical
application. Include only those drawings which meet the definition of
‘Source Control Drawing’ in the national specification. (Applicable only to
Type 1, 1B, 2 , 4 and 4B Item Identification).
2 Definitive Government Specification or Standard Designator Reference. A
partIdentifier, Style Number, or Type Designator included in, or developed
in accordance with, a Government Specification or Standard, which has the
effect of fully identifying an item of supply. This code shall also be used of a
Government Specification or Standard which, although not including
partIdentifiers, Style Numbers, or Type Designators, covers a single item of
supply. These Reference Numbers may be coded with a variation code of
‘1’. (Non-definitive Government Specifications or Standard designator
reference shall be code 4; specification control drawings as defined in the
appropriate National Specification shall be code 7; Professional Association
or Standard Designator references shall be coded 3).
3  Design Control Reference. The primary number used to identify an item of
production or a range of items of production, by the Manufacturer
(individual, company, firm, corporation, or government activity) which
controls the design, CHARACTERISTICS, and production of the item by
means of its engineering drawings, specifications and inspection
requirements.
4 Non-definitive Government Specification or Standard Reference. Any
Government specification or standard reference other than those indicated
in code 2 as definitive references. This code shall be used for non-definitive
Government Specifications and Standard references and non-definitive
partIdentifiers, type designators, and style numbers included therein which
are coded with a variation code of ‘1’. (Includes the Specification Number of
those specifications for which type designation is used as code 2. Excludes
Professional Association, Industrial Association, or Manufacturer’s
Specification or standard reference which shall be code 3, and specification
control drawings as defined in the National Specification which shall be
coded 7).
5  Secondary Reference. Any additional number, other than a primary number
(codes 1, 2, 3, 4 or 7) or informative reference (code 6) assigned to an item of
production or supply by a commercial or government organization, which
represents the same item of production or supply to which the NSN was
assigned. The Reference Number may have had an RNCC of 1, 2, 3, 4 or 7,
but has since been replaced in the item of supply concept of the NSN by
another primary number. Includes additional numbers assigned by the design
control organization, additional numbers assigned by other than the design
control organization; superseded or cancelled specifications; superseded or
discontinued Reference Numbers which may have resulted from: a
Manufacturer’s change in Reference numbering; the Manufacturer no longer
produces the item or is no longer a technically approved source; the
Manufacturer or Supplier under that number is out of business.
6  Informative Reference. Any reference related to the NSN which does not fall
into any other category.
7  Specification Control Reference. The number assigned by a design activity to
a drawing that is not item identifying, but which delineates existing commercial
or vendor developed items meeting all engineering and test requirements
specified, without imposing additional test/engineering requirements not
normally provided by the vendor(s). Includes only those drawings which meet
the definition of Specification Control Drawing.
8  NATO Reproduced Item Identification Number. A number representing a
reproduction of an item of production by another NATO country for which
authorization to use the NATO Stock Number has been granted by the
originating country. The reproduced item represents the same item of
production as the original item.
A  Design Category Packaging and Related Logistics Data Reference Number.
The number of a document representing packaging and related logistics data
requirements.
B  Non-Design Category Packaging and Related Logistics Data Reference
Number. The number of a Military Standard and applicable standard
designation decoded in the standard publication.
C  A Reference Number assigned to an item of production not included in the
item of supply concept to which the NATO Stock Number (NSN) has been
assigned. Use of this REFERENCE NUMBER CATEGORY code (RNC) is
restricted to conditions where cross-reference is required to establish
identification to an item of supply. Additionally, there is no direct relationship
of the Reference Number to the NSN other than a service/agency individual
decision.
D  Drawing Number Reference. A number assigned by a design activity to a
drawing or other technical documentation which identifies a
drawing/document that is related to an item of supply or production but
does not qualify for assignment of codes 1, 2, 5, 7 or C. Code D Reference
will not be used in item of supply determinations.
REMARK(S)
The referenceNumberCategory will be allocated to items which have a NATO STOCK
NUMBER.
NOTES:
1  Each Reference Number or portion of a Reference Number shall be coded to
indicate the relationship of the Reference Number to the item of supply.
2  When determination cannot be made as to whether or not a Reference
Number is the ‘design control reference’, it shall be considered the ‘design
control reference’ until positive determination can be made. However, only one
Reference Number shall be considered as the ‘design control reference’ for
each Type 1A, 1B, 4A or 4B Item Identification. In addition, only one Reference
Number shall be considered as the ‘design control reference’ for each item of
production included in the concept of a Type 1, Type 2 or Type 4 Item
Identification.
3  All actions against Reference Numbers given in reply to SR-1 or SR-5 on Item
Identification Cards shall be in accordance with national regulations.
4  Reference Numbers assigned RNC D will always be submitted with a variation
CODE REFERENCE NUMBER VARIATION CODE (RNV) of 9.
5  Reference Numbers assigned RNC C will always be submitted with a variation
code (RNV) of 1.

CODE(S)
See the following Table (Taken from the NATO Manual on Codification ACodP-1):
CODE  EXPLANATION
1  A design control reference or other Reference Number that does not identify an
item of production without the use of additional information, or is either a
specification, part, type or similar reference number that does not identify an
item of supply without the use of additional information.
2  A design control reference or other Reference Number that is an item-
identifying number for an item of production, or is either a source control
reference, a specification or a standard part, type, or similar Reference Number
that is an item identifying number for an item of supply.
3  A vendor’s Reference Number on a source control item which is reparable
through the removal, exchange, and reinstallation of component parts. The
related Source Control Document Number will also reflect the code 3. This
code is limited to a type 1B or 4B item identification.
9  A specification, standard, or other Reference Number which has been
superseded, cancelled, is obsolete, or discontinued and has REFERENCE
NUMBER CATEGORY CODE (RNCC) 5 or the Reference Number is for
information only and has RNCC 6.
REMARK(S)
The referenceNumberVariant will be allocated to items which have a NATO STOCK
NUMBER.
Notes: 
1.  Each Reference Number or portion of a Reference Number, shall be coded
as follows:
a. The Reference Number for a Manufacturer’s source or a specification
controlling reference for a Type 1, 2, or 4 Item Identification shall
always contain the Variation Code ‘2’.
b. For Type 1A, 1B, 4A or 4B Item Identification the Reference Number
for a related non-definitive specification or standard Reference
Number shall always contain the Variation Code ‘1’.
c. For a Type 1A or 4A Item Identification, the ‘design control reference’
cited on the Item Identification Card shall always be item-identifying
of the production and this Reference Number shall always contain the
Variation Code ‘2’. Additional Reference Numbers related to Type 1A
or 4A Item Identifications other than the Reference Number cited on
the Item Identification Card, may contain a Variation Code of ‘1’ or ‘2’
depending on whether or not the Reference Number must be
supplemented in order to identify the same item of production.
An activity submitting such an additional Reference Number to a Type
1A or 4 Item Identification which requires the variation code ‘1’ shall be
prepared to furnish data substantiating that the submitted Reference
Number with stated modifications or changes, represents the same item
of production as the Reference Number cited on the Item Identification
Card.
d. For a Type 1B or 4B Item Identification, the ‘design control reference’
cited on the Item Identification Card shall always be the type which
requires supplementary data to identify the item of production and this
Reference Number shall always contain the variation code ‘1’.
Additional Reference Numbers related to a Type 1B or 4B Item
Identification, other than the Reference Number cited on the Item
Identification Card may contain a variation code of ‘1’ or ‘2’ depending
on whether or not the Reference Number must be supplemented in
order to identify the same item of production. An activity submitting an
additional Reference Number for a Type 1B or 4B Item Identification
which does not require the variation code ‘1’ shall be prepared to
furnish data substantiating that the submitted Reference Number
represents the same item of production represented by the ‘design
control reference’ and the content of the differentiating characteristic(s)
cited on the applicable Item Identification Card.
e. For a Type 2 Item Identification, the ‘design control reference’ for each
item of production included in the Type 2 concept shall always be item-
identifying of the item of production and shall always contain the
variation code ‘2’. Where an additional reference is known to represent
the same item of production as the ‘design control reference’, the
reference (always containing Reference Number Category code 5) may
contain the variation code ‘1’ or ‘2’ depending on whether or not the
number must be supplemented in order to identify the item of
production. Where an additional reference is coded Reference Number
Category code ‘4’, the variation code shall always be ‘1’.
2.  When a definitive specification or standard designator reference (Reference
Number Category Code 2) constitutes the only available reference related to a
proposed Type 2 Item Identification, and this reference has the effect of fully
identifying the item of supply, such a Reference Number must be submitted for
assignment of an NSN. In such a case, the Reference Number shall contain the
variation code ‘2’.

DESCRIPTION/PURPOSE
Indicates the recommended quantity of the item which is required to support an agreed level
of maintenance to the usage pattern and period notified by the Customer. The agreed level
of maintenance is indicated through the maintenanceLevel (MLV).
The recommendedSparesQuantity will be presented with and has to be read in conjunction
with the maintenanceLevel (MLV).
CODE(S)
Enter the actual quantity conforming to the unitOfIssue (UOI).
REMARK(S)
The recommendedSparesQuantity is provided in accordance with the Customer's
maintenance concept. In the 'normal' CATALOGUE SEQUENCE NUMBER orientated
provisioning process the recommendedSparesQuantity represents the quantity required for
use at the location at which the item is recommended.
In the Part Number oriented provisioning process the recommendedSparesQuantity
represents the 'total' recommended quantity for use in the end item for which the
provisioningProjectIdentifier (IPP) is allocated and is based upon the quantity provided in
the total quantity.
The use and application of this data element is to be agreed between the Customer and
Contractor at the start of the project.

DESCRIPTION/PURPOSE
Provides a two way link between the two locations that an item has when it appears in the
breakdown of one figure and is ‘referred out’ to a separate figure which is created to present
the breakdown of that item. It also provides a one way link between an item, in its position
within the breakdown of its next higher assembly, and its own separate Provisioning
presentation.

REMARK(S)
When reference is made within the same Illustrated Parts Catalogue (IPC), enter the full
figureItemIdentifier (CSN) and figureItemSequenceNumber (ISN) of the item's other
location. The Format is to be that defined for figureItemIdentifier (CSN) and
figureItemSequenceNumber (ISN). When a position of the figureItemIdentifier (CSN) of the
item’s other location is blank then it must also be blank in the FigureItemReference.
When an item is 'referred out' to its own separate IP Project (i.e. it has a repairabilityStrategy
(SPC) of 6 then enter the ABBREVIATION 'IPP' followed by the IP Project Number, instead
of figureItemIdentifier and figureItemSequenceNumber. In this case the link will be just one
way.

DESCRIPTION/PURPOSE
The succeedingFigureItemSequenceNumberInterchangeability (SIY) together with the
precedingFigureItemSequenceNumberInterchangeability (PIY) indicate the
interchangeability of two or more items at the same location either for the same
configuration or, when a partIdentifier (PID) change is involved, across two different
Configuration Standards.
CODE(S)
See precedingFigureItemSequenceNumberInterchangeability (PIY)
REMARK(S)
APPLICATION
The interchangeability code will only be applied when two or more interchangeable items
are presented at the same location.
The numeric interchangeability codes will only be used where interchangeability conditions
have been positively identified.
As the interchangeability of different Configuration Standards will be defined by the Change
Authority introducing the change, the level of breakdown to which the interchangeability
code can be applied will be dependent upon that which is expressed by the Change
Authority. It may, therefore, not be possible to identify the interchangeability condition down
to full breakdown level in all cases.
When applied across different configuration standards, the interchangeability is to be read in
conjunction with the the serialNumberLowerBound (SLB) and the serialNumberUpperBound

DESCRIPTION/PURPOSE
A code assigned to a shelf life item to specify the type of inspection, test or restorative
action to be taken when the item has reached its storage shelf life, and to specify the
extension of the shelf life time period after the test/restorative action has been completed .
CODE(S)
The following codes are taken from the NATO Manual On Codification ACodP-1: :
C  Incorporate all mandatory changes. If found satisfactory, extend the previously
established shelf life by the time period, given in the Shelf Life Code.
CO Check/inspect/test IAW inventory manager's instructions/technical instructions. 
CT  Incorporate all mandatory changes, perform minor adjustment required, clean and
re-lubricate bearings, reassemble, test to post overhaul standards, and correct
any observed discrepancies. Items which pass tests shall be returned to stock
ready for issue.
L  To be tested by the laboratory/organization after the initial shelf life has expired
and at specified time intervals thereafter. If found satisfactory, extend the
previously established shelf life by the time period, given in the Shelf Life Code.
This code will be used to indicate the time period at which samples should be
periodically submitted to the laboratory/organization/activity for testing after the
initial shelf life has expired. If item fails test, take disposal action.
RD Replace all deteriorated and non-metallic components subject to deterioration
(disassemble and process to the level required to permit replacement of
deteriorable items (e. g. seals, gaskets) test to post- overhaul standards and
return to stock as RFI item with fully restored storage time limitations). Exterior
package marking of such items shall indicate the latest date of overhaul.
RJ  This is assigned to fuel metering equipment, which has been tested by other than 
BS7118/ MIL-F-7024 or similar standards.
RN Provides for equipment that has been tested with fluids indicated by Specification
(e. g. BS7118 MIL-F-7024 or similar standards) and has not subsequently been
operated with other fluids. (Use for fuel metering equipment only.)
S9  Identification of Safety Items. A safety item designated by the Project/Requiring
authority that is subject to a 5 year age limitation when used for purposes
involving safety of personnel. Material in this category that is over 5 years old will
not be use
SA  Salvage 
SB  Request cannibalization/investigate salvage instructions from inventory
manager/technical instructions.
T  Test, if Item passes test, extend previously established shelf life by the time
period given in the Shelf Life Code and process IAW with code RD. This code will
be used to indicate the time period that the shelf life may be extended after
passing test and processing in accordance with code RD.
UU Unsuitable for restoration to issuable status. At end of shelf life period, material
will be disposed of IAW existing instructions.
X  Test. If item passes a test, extend the previously established shelf life by the
appropriate time period, given in the Shelf Life CODE. This code will be used to
indicate the time period that the shelf life may be extended. If item fails tests,
dispose of it in accordance with existing instructions.
REMARK(S)
The shelfLifeLimitAction is to be provided against those items, which have a
shelfLifeLimitType (SLT) Type II.

Identifies the range of Customer's Products on which the item is fitted in this location.
CODE(S)
serialNumberLowerBound: Enter the ‘from’ number of the Product to indicate the
beginning of the range.
When an item is not limited to a range of Customer’s Products, but fitted to all, the data
element should not be filled.

The serialNumberLowerBound (SLB) must always be presented with and read in
conjunction with the serialNumberUpperBound (SUB).
This data element will only be provided in the Initial Provisioning (IP) presentation of the
Product, it will not be given in the separate IP presentation of equipment, independently of
chapterized or non-chapterized presentation.
The application of a cross reference coding system in this data element is to be agreed
between the Customer and Contractor at the start of the project.
The serialNumberLowerBound should normally be identified by quoting the 'from' build line
number. Where alternative methods are negotiated, e.g. by identifying ranges of Products
by a cross reference coding system, the code identified in the serialNumberLowerBound
field must be preceded by an asterisk '*'. This cross reference coding system would be
described in the Illustrated Parts Catalogue introduction.

DESCRIPTION/PURPOSE
A code agreed in a project to define different standard handling unit Formats if required. It
enables the participating parties to define the most common handling unit sizes without the
need to transmit the exact measurements of the handling units every time.
There are no limits to the potential content of a project specific defined SUF, so any
information can be transmitted if defined before.

REMARK(S)
The use and application of additional codes is to be agreed between the Customer and
Contractor.
The code 0 is used for not previously defined package (handling unit) Formats. In that case
the size of the package must be defined by using the data elements HHU, LHU and WIU.
This Data Element could also define the MAXIMUM OF STACKING HEIGHT (MSH) of a
handling unit at the same time. In this instance there will not be the need to use MSH
additionally if SUF is used.

ATTRIBUTE(S)  --
USAGE
Ch.1 (provisioning)
DESCRIPTION/PURPOSE
Identifies the number of times an item is used at the location which the data represents, within
the end item for which the Provisioning list is prepared. The location is defined by the
figureItemIdentifier and the figureItemSequenceNumber.
CODE(S)
Enter the actual quantity.
When the quantityInNextHigherAssembly is ‘AR’ or ‘REF’, then the
totalQuantityForProvisioningProject must also be ‘AR’ or ‘REF’ respectively, if not otherwise
agreed.
REMARK(S)
The TQL is calculated by taking the quantityInNextHigherAssembly of the item and multiplying it
by the TQL of its next higher assembly, where both values are numeric. If TQL of the next higher
assembly is alphanumeric, then for calculation purposes it assumes the value of 1.
If TQL of the next higher assembly is 'REF', then for calculation purposes it assumes the value
of 1. In the majority of cases, the use of value ‘1’ provides the correct calculation of the TQL.
However, an agreement may be reached to use the TQL of the next higher assembly in its
referred to location (shown in FigureItemReference (RTX)).
Because of the complex nature of this data element and the extent to which its calculation can or
should be carried through the hierarchy of the next higher assemblies, the calculation rule of the
TQL should be agreed between Customer and Contractor.

When a breakdown part is applicable to all the V/Cs then no code is assigned.
The UCA should be used only in those cases where the resulting presentation gives a clear
relationship between part and assembly. It cannot be used to differentiate subassembly
variants, and their breakdown parts, within assembly variants.
Where a clear relationship between part and assembly cannot be provided, or in cases
where more than six variant assemblies exist, the assembly breakdowns should be
presented separately or in smaller groups.
Mirrored assemblies should be treated as assembly variants.
In the Illustrated Parts Catalogue whenever the UCA has a value it should always be
prefixed by a double asterisk (**) to differentiate it from USABLE ON CODE EQUIPMENT
